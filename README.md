# React : Babel + Webpack + Sass boilerplate application


Learned from https://blog.marcnuri.com/react-babel-webpack-sass-application/

You can visit the application here [http://edwardlanto.github.io/context-api](http://edwardlanto.github.io/context-api)

I used this starter to as scaffold a simple React form application. I added different file types than the example and added the appropriate loaders. Hot reloading is enabled along with recommend babel transformers to transpile ES6 code to something all browsers can understand.

## Run the app

It is currently running at Github.

You can also run it locally. Just clone this repo.

Next, run:

    npm install --save-dev
    npm start
`
